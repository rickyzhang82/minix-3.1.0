Introduction
============

   Most graphical user interface toolkits provide a number of standard
user interface controls (sometimes known as `widgets' or `gadgets').
Emacs doesn't really support anything like this, except for an
incredibly powerful text "widget."  On the other hand, Emacs does
provide the necessary primitives to implement many other widgets within
a text buffer.  The `widget' package simplifies this task.

   The basic widgets are:

`link'
     Areas of text with an associated action.  Intended for hypertext
     links embedded in text.

`push-button'
     Like link, but intended for stand-alone buttons.

`editable-field'
     An editable text field.  It can be either variable or fixed length.

`menu-choice'
     Allows the user to choose one of multiple options from a menu, each
     option is itself a widget.  Only the selected option will be
     visible in the buffer.

`radio-button-choice'
     Allows the user to choose one of multiple options by activating
     radio buttons.  The options are implemented as widgets.  All
     options will be visible in the buffer.

`item'
     A simple constant widget intended to be used in the `menu-choice'
     and `radio-button-choice' widgets.

`choice-item'
     A button item only intended for use in choices.  When invoked, the
     user will be asked to select another option from the choice widget.

`toggle'
     A simple `on'/`off' switch.

`checkbox'
     A checkbox (`[ ]'/`[X]').

`editable-list'
     Create an editable list.  The user can insert or delete items in
     the list.  Each list item is itself a widget.

   Now, of what possible use can support for widgets be in a text
editor?  I'm glad you asked.  The answer is that widgets are useful for
implementing forms.  A "form" in Emacs is a buffer where the user is
supposed to fill out a number of fields, each of which has a specific
meaning.  The user is not supposed to change or delete any of the text
between the fields.  Examples of forms in Emacs are the `forms' package
(of course), the customize buffers, the mail and news compose modes,
and the HTML form support in the `w3' browser.

   The advantages for a programmer of using the `widget' package to
implement forms are:

  1. More complex fields than just editable text are supported.

  2. You can give the users immediate feedback if they enter invalid
     data in a text field, and sometimes prevent entering invalid data.

  3. You can have fixed sized fields, thus allowing multiple fields to
     be lined up in columns.

  4. It is simple to query or set the value of a field.

  5. Editing happens in the buffer, not in the mini-buffer.

  6. Packages using the library get a uniform look, making them easier
     for the user to learn.

  7. As support for embedded graphics improve, the widget library will
     be extended to use the GUI features.  This means that your code
     using the widget library will also use the new graphic features
     automatically.

   In order to minimize the code that is loaded by users who does not
create any widgets, the code has been split in two files:

`widget.el'
     This will declare the user variables, define the function
     `define-widget', and autoload the function `widget-create'.

`wid-edit.el'
     Everything else is here, there is no reason to load it explicitly,
     as it will be autoloaded when needed.

User Interface
==============

   A form consist of read only text for documentation and some fields,
where each field contains two parts, a tag and a value.  The tags are
used to identify the fields, so the documentation can refer to the `foo
field', meaning the field tagged with `Foo'. Here is an example form:

     Here is some documentation.
     
     Name: My Name     *Choose*: This option
     Address:  Some Place
     In some City
     Some country.
     
     See also _other work_ for more information.
     
     Numbers: count to three below
     [INS] [DEL] One
     [INS] [DEL] Eh, two?
     [INS] [DEL] Five!
     [INS]
     
     Select multiple:
     
     [X] This
     [ ] That
     [X] Thus
     
     Select one:
     
     (*) One
     ( ) Another One.
     ( ) A Final One.
     
     [Apply Form] [Reset Form]

   The top level widgets in is example are tagged `Name', `Choose',
`Address', `_other work_', `Numbers', `Select multiple', `Select one',
`[Apply Form]', and `[Reset Form]'.  There are basically two things the
user can do within a form, namely editing the editable text fields and
activating the buttons.

Editable Text Fields
--------------------

   In the example, the value for the `Name' is most likely displayed in
an editable text field, and so are values for each of the members of
the `Numbers' list.  All the normal Emacs editing operations are
available for editing these fields.  The only restriction is that each
change you make must be contained within a single editable text field.
For example, capitalizing all text from the middle of one field to the
middle of another field is prohibited.

   Editing text fields are created by the `editable-field' widget.

   The editing text fields are highlighted with the `widget-field-face'
face, making them easy to find.

 - Face: widget-field-face
     Face used for other editing fields.

Buttons
-------

   Some portions of the buffer have an associated "action", which can
be "invoked" by a standard key or mouse command.  These portions are
called "buttons".  The default commands for activating a button are:

`<RET>'
      - Command: widget-button-press POS &optional EVENT
          Invoke the button at POS, defaulting to point.  If point is
          not located on a button, invoke the binding in
          `widget-global-map' (by default the global map).

`Mouse-2'
      - Command: widget-button-click EVENT
          Invoke the button at the location of the mouse pointer.  If
          the mouse pointer is located in an editable text field,
          invoke the binding in `widget-global-map' (by default the
          global map).

   There are several different kind of buttons, all of which are
present in the example:

_The Option Field Tags_
     When you invoke one of these buttons, you will be asked to choose
     between a number of different options.  This is how you edit an
     option field.  Option fields are created by the `menu-choice'
     widget.  In the example, `Choose' is an option field tag.

_The `[INS]' and `[DEL]' buttons_
     Activating these will insert or delete elements from an editable
     list.  The list is created by the `editable-list' widget.

_Embedded Buttons_
     The `_other work_' is an example of an embedded button.  Embedded
     buttons are not associated with a fields, but can serve any
     purpose, such as implementing hypertext references.  They are
     usually created by the `link' widget.

_The `[ ]' and `[X]' buttons_
     Activating one of these will convert it to the other.  This is
     useful for implementing multiple-choice fields.  You can create it
     with the `checkbox' widget.

_The `( )' and `(*)' buttons_
     Only one radio button in a `radio-button-choice' widget can be
     selected at any time.  When you invoke one of the unselected radio
     buttons, it will be selected and the previous selected radio
     button will become unselected.

_The `[Apply Form]' `[Reset Form]' buttons_
     These are explicit buttons made with the `push-button' widget.  The
     main difference from the `link' widget is that the buttons will be
     displayed as GUI buttons when possible.

   To make them easier to locate, buttons are emphasized in the buffer.

 - Face: widget-button-face
     Face used for buttons.

 - User Option: widget-mouse-face
     Face used for highlighting a button when the mouse pointer moves
     across it.

Navigation
----------

   You can use all the normal Emacs commands to move around in a form
buffer, plus you will have these additional commands:

`<TAB>'
      - Command: widget-forward &optional count
          Move point COUNT buttons or editing fields forward.

`<M-TAB>'
      - Command: widget-backward &optional count
          Move point COUNT buttons or editing fields backward.

Programming Example
===================

   Here is the code to implement the user interface example (*note User
Interface::).

     (require 'widget)

Setting Up the Buffer
=====================

   Widgets are created with `widget-create', which returns a "widget"
object.  This object can be queried and manipulated by other widget
functions, until it is deleted with `widget-delete'.  After the widgets
have been created, `widget-setup' must be called to enable them.

 - Function: widget-create type [ keyword argument ]...
     Create and return a widget of type TYPE.  The syntax for the TYPE
     argument is described in *Note Basic Types::.

     The keyword arguments can be used to overwrite the keyword
     arguments that are part of TYPE.

 - Function: widget-delete widget
     Delete WIDGET and remove it from the buffer.

 - Function: widget-setup
     Set up a buffer to support widgets.

     This should be called after creating all the widgets and before
     allowing the user to edit them.


   If you want to insert text outside the widgets in the form, the
recommended way to do that is with `widget-insert'.

 - Function: widget-insert
     Insert the arguments, either strings or characters, at point.  The
     inserted text will be read-only.

   There is a standard widget keymap which you might find useful.

 - Const: widget-keymap
     A keymap with the global keymap as its parent.
     <TAB> and `C-<TAB>' are bound to `widget-forward' and
     `widget-backward', respectively.  <RET> and `Mouse-2' are bound to
     `widget-button-press' and `widget-button-click'.

 - Variable: widget-global-map
     Keymap used by `widget-button-press' and `widget-button-click'
     when not on a button.  By default this is `global-map'.


File: widget,  Node: Basic Types,  Next: Sexp Types,  Prev: Setting Up the Buffer,  Up: Top

Basic Types
===========

   The syntax of a type specification is given below:

     NAME ::= (NAME [KEYWORD ARGUMENT]... ARGS)
          |   NAME

   Where, NAME is a widget name, KEYWORD is the name of a property,
ARGUMENT is the value of the property, and ARGS are interpreted in a
widget specific way.

   The following keyword arguments that apply to all widgets:

`:value'
     The initial value for widgets of this type.

`:format'
     This string will be inserted in the buffer when you create a
     widget.  The following `%' escapes are available:

    `%['
    `%]'
          The text inside will be marked as a button.

          By default, the text will be shown in `widget-button-face',
          and surrounded by brackets.

           - User Option: widget-button-prefix
               String to prefix buttons.

           - User Option: widget-button-suffix
               String to suffix buttons.

    `%{'
    `%}'
          The text inside will be displayed with the face specified by
          `:sample-face'.

    `%v'
          This will be replaced with the buffer representation of the
          widget's value.  What this is depends on the widget type.

    `%d'
          Insert the string specified by `:doc' here.

    `%h'
          Like `%d', with the following modifications: If the
          documentation string is more than one line, it will add a
          button which will toggle between showing only the first line,
          and showing the full text.  Furthermore, if there is no
          `:doc' property in the widget, it will instead examine the
          `:documentation-property' property.  If it is a lambda
          expression, it will be called with the widget's value as an
          argument, and the result will be used as the documentation
          text.

    `%t'
          Insert the string specified by `:tag' here, or the `princ'
          representation of the value if there is no tag.

    `%%'
          Insert a literal `%'.

`:button-face'
     Face used to highlight text inside %[ %] in the format.

`:button-prefix'
`:button-suffix'
     Text around %[ %] in the format.

     These can be
    _nil_
          No text is inserted.

    _a string_
          The string is inserted literally.

    _a symbol_
          The value of the symbol is expanded according to this table.

`:doc'
     The string inserted by the `%d' escape in the format string.

`:tag'
     The string inserted by the `%t' escape in the format string.

`:tag-glyph'
     Name of image to use instead of the string specified by `:tag' on
     Emacsen that supports it.

`:help-echo'
     Specifies how to display a message whenever you move to the widget
     with either `widget-forward' or `widget-backward' or move the mouse
     over it (using the standard `help-echo' mechanism).  The argument
     is either a string to display or a function of one argument, the
     widget, which should return a string to display.

`:indent'
     An integer indicating the absolute number of spaces to indent
     children of this widget.

`:offset'
     An integer indicating how many extra spaces to add to the widget's
     grandchildren compared to this widget.

`:extra-offset'
     An integer indicating how many extra spaces to add to the widget's
     children compared to this widget.

`:notify'
     A function called each time the widget or a nested widget is
     changed.  The function is called with two or three arguments.  The
     first argument is the widget itself, the second argument is the
     widget that was changed, and the third argument is the event
     leading to the change, if any.

`:menu-tag'
     Tag used in the menu when the widget is used as an option in a
     `menu-choice' widget.

`:menu-tag-get'
     Function used for finding the tag when the widget is used as an
     option in a `menu-choice' widget.  By default, the tag used will
     be either the `:menu-tag' or `:tag' property if present, or the
     `princ' representation of the `:value' property if not.

`:match'
     Should be a function called with two arguments, the widget and a
     value, and returning non-nil if the widget can represent the
     specified value.

`:validate'
     A function which takes a widget as an argument, and returns `nil'
     if the widget's current value is valid for the widget.  Otherwise
     it should return the widget containing the invalid data, and set
     that widget's `:error' property to a string explaining the error.

     The following predefined function can be used:

      - Function: widget-children-validate widget
          All the `:children' of WIDGET must be valid.

`:tab-order'
     Specify the order in which widgets are traversed with
     `widget-forward' or `widget-backward'.  This is only partially
     implemented.

       a. Widgets with tabbing order `-1' are ignored.

       b. (Unimplemented) When on a widget with tabbing order N, go to
          the next widget in the buffer with tabbing order N+1 or `nil',
          whichever comes first.

       c. When on a widget with no tabbing order specified, go to the
          next widget in the buffer with a positive tabbing order, or
          `nil'

`:parent'
     The parent of a nested widget (e.g. a `menu-choice' item or an
     element of a `editable-list' widget).

`:sibling-args'
     This keyword is only used for members of a `radio-button-choice' or
     `checklist'.  The value should be a list of extra keyword
     arguments, which will be used when creating the `radio-button' or
     `checkbox' associated with this item.

 - User Option: widget-glyph-directory
     Directory where glyphs are found.  Widget will look here for a
     file with the same name as specified for the image, with either a
     `.xpm' (if supported) or `.xbm' extension.

 - User Option: widget-glyph-enable
     If non-nil, allow glyphs to appear on displays where they are
     supported.

     if the field contains a password or other secret information.  By
     default, this is nil, and the value is not secret.

`:valid-regexp'
     By default the `:validate' function will match the content of the
     field with the value of this attribute.  The default value is `""'
     which matches everything.

`:keymap'
     Keymap used in the editable field.  The default value is
     `widget-field-keymap', which allows you to use all the normal
     editing commands, even if the buffer's major mode suppresses some
     of them.  Pressing <RET> invokes the function specified by
     `:action'.

Sexp Types
==========

   A number of widgets for editing "s-expressions" (lisp types), sexp
for short, are also available.  These basically fall in several
categories described in this section.

* Menu:

* constants::
* generic::
* atoms::
* composite::


File: widget,  Node: constants,  Next: generic,  Prev: Sexp Types,  Up: Sexp Types

The Constant Widgets
--------------------

   The `const' widget can contain any lisp expression, but the user is
prohibited from editing it, which is mainly useful as a component of one
of the composite widgets.

   The syntax for the `const' widget is:

     TYPE ::= (const [KEYWORD ARGUMENT]...  [ VALUE ])

   The VALUE, if present, is used to initialize the `:value' property
and can be any s-expression.

 - Widget: const
     This will display any valid s-expression in an immutable part of
     the buffer.

   There are two variations of the `const' widget, namely
`variable-item' and `function-item'.  These should contain a symbol
with a variable or function binding.  The major difference from the
`const' widget is that they will allow the user to see the variable or
function documentation for the symbol.

 - Widget: variable-item
     An immutable symbol that is bound as a variable.

 - Widget: function-item
     An immutable symbol that is bound as a function.


File: widget,  Node: generic,  Next: atoms,  Prev: constants,  Up: Sexp Types

Generic Sexp Widget
-------------------

   The `sexp' widget can contain any lisp expression, and allows the
user to edit it inline in the buffer.

   The syntax for the `sexp' widget is:

     TYPE ::= (sexp [KEYWORD ARGUMENT]...  [ VALUE ])

 - Widget: sexp
     This will allow you to edit any valid s-expression in an editable
     buffer field.

     The `sexp' widget takes the same keyword arguments as the
     `editable-field' widget.  *Note editable-field::.


File: widget,  Node: atoms,  Next: composite,  Prev: generic,  Up: Sexp Types

Atomic Sexp Widgets
-------------------

   The atoms are s-expressions that do not consist of other
s-expressions.  For example, a string, a file name, or a symbol are
atoms, while a list is a composite type.  You can edit the value of an
atom with the following widgets.

   The syntax for all the atoms are:

     TYPE ::= (NAME [KEYWORD ARGUMENT]...  [ VALUE ])

   The VALUE, if present, is used to initialize the `:value' property
and must be an expression of the same type as the widget.  That is, the
string widget can only be initialized with a string.

   All the atom widgets take the same keyword arguments as the
`editable-field' widget.  *Note editable-field::.

 - Widget: string
     Allows you to edit a string in an editable field.

 - Widget: regexp
     Allows you to edit a regular expression in an editable field.

 - Widget: character
     Allows you to enter a character in an editable field.

 - Widget: file
     Allows you to edit a file name in an editable field.  If you invoke
     the tag button, you can edit the file name in the mini-buffer with
     completion.

     Keywords:
    `:must-match'
          If this is set to non-nil, only existing file names will be
          allowed in the minibuffer.

 - Widget: directory
     Allows you to edit a directory name in an editable field.  Similar
     to the `file' widget.

 - Widget: symbol
     Allows you to edit a lisp symbol in an editable field.

 - Widget: function
     Allows you to edit a lambda expression, or a function name with
     completion.

 - Widget: variable
     Allows you to edit a variable name, with completion.

 - Widget: integer
     Allows you to edit an integer in an editable field.

 - Widget: number
     Allows you to edit a number in an editable field.

 - Widget: boolean
     Allows you to edit a boolean.  In lisp this means a variable which
     is either nil meaning false, or non-nil meaning true.


File: widget,  Node: composite,  Prev: atoms,  Up: Sexp Types

Composite Sexp Widgets
----------------------

   The syntax for the composite widget is:

     TYPE ::= (NAME [KEYWORD ARGUMENT]...  COMPONENT...)

where each COMPONENT must be a widget type.  Each component widget will
be displayed in the buffer, and will be editable by the user.

 - Widget: cons
     The value of a `cons' widget is a cons-cell where the `car' is the
     value of the first component and the `cdr' is the value of the
     second component.  There must be exactly two components.

 - Widget: list
     The value of a `list' widget is a list containing the value of
     each of its component.

 - Widget: vector
     The value of a `vector' widget is a vector containing the value of
     each of its component.

   The above suffice for specifying fixed size lists and vectors.  To
get variable length lists and vectors, you can use a `choice', `set',
or `repeat' widgets together with the `:inline' keywords.  If any
component of a composite widget has the `:inline' keyword set, its
value must be a list which will then be spliced into the composite.
For example, to specify a list whose first element must be a file name,
and whose remaining arguments should either by the symbol `t' or two
files, you can use the following widget specification:

     (list file
           (choice (const t)
                   (list :inline t
                         :value ("foo" "bar")
                         string string)))

   The value of a widget of this type will either have the form `(file
t)' or `(file string string)'.

   This concept of inline is probably hard to understand.  It was
certainly hard to implement, so instead of confusing you more by trying
to explain it here, I'll just suggest you meditate over it for a while.

 - Widget: choice
     Allows you to edit a sexp which may have one of a fixed set of
     types.  It is currently implemented with the `choice-menu' basic
     widget, and has a similar syntax.

 - Widget: set
     Allows you to specify a type which must be a list whose elements
     all belong to given set.  The elements of the list are not
     significant.  This is implemented on top of the `checklist' basic
     widget, and has a similar syntax.

 - Widget: repeat
     Allows you to specify a variable length list whose members are all
     of the same type.  Implemented on top of the `editable-list' basic
     widget, and has a similar syntax.


File: widget,  Node: Widget Properties,  Next: Defining New Widgets,  Prev: Sexp Types,  Up: Top

Properties
==========

   You can examine or set the value of a widget by using the widget
object that was returned by `widget-create'.

 - Function: widget-value widget
     Return the current value contained in WIDGET.  It is an error to
     call this function on an uninitialized widget.

 - Function: widget-value-set widget value
     Set the value contained in WIDGET to VALUE.  It is an error to
     call this function with an invalid VALUE.

   *Important:* You _must_ call `widget-setup' after modifying the
value of a widget before the user is allowed to edit the widget again.
It is enough to call `widget-setup' once if you modify multiple
widgets.  This is currently only necessary if the widget contains an
editing field, but may be necessary for other widgets in the future.

   If your application needs to associate some information with the
widget objects, for example a reference to the item being edited, it
can be done with `widget-put' and `widget-get'.  The property names
must begin with a `:'.

 - Function: widget-put widget property value
     In WIDGET set PROPERTY to VALUE.  PROPERTY should be a symbol,
     while VALUE can be anything.

 - Function: widget-get widget property
     In WIDGET return the value for PROPERTY.  PROPERTY should be a
     symbol, the value is what was last set by `widget-put' for
     PROPERTY.

 - Function: widget-member widget property
     Non-nil if WIDGET has a value (even nil) for property PROPERTY.

   Occasionally it can be useful to know which kind of widget you have,
i.e. the name of the widget type you gave when the widget was created.

 - Function: widget-type widget
     Return the name of WIDGET, a symbol.

   Widgets can be in two states: active, which means they are
modifiable by the user, or inactive, which means they cannot be
modified by the user.  You can query or set the state with the
following code:

     ;; Examine if WIDGET is active or not.
     (if (widget-apply WIDGET :active)
         (message "Widget is active.")
       (message "Widget is inactive.")
     
     ;; Make WIDGET inactive.
     (widget-apply WIDGET :deactivate)
     
     ;; Make WIDGET active.
     (widget-apply WIDGET :activate)

   A widget is inactive if it, or any of its ancestors (found by
following the `:parent' link), have been deactivated.  To make sure a
widget is really active, you must therefore activate both it and all
its ancestors.

     (while widget
       (widget-apply widget :activate)
       (setq widget (widget-get widget :parent)))

   You can check if a widget has been made inactive by examining the
value of the `:inactive' keyword.  If this is non-nil, the widget itself
has been deactivated.  This is different from using the `:active'
keyword, in that the latter tells you if the widget *or* any of its
ancestors have been deactivated.  Do not attempt to set the `:inactive'
keyword directly.  Use the `:activate' `:deactivate' keywords instead.


File: widget,  Node: Defining New Widgets,  Next: Widget Browser,  Prev: Widget Properties,  Up: Top

Defining New Widgets
====================

   You can define specialized widgets with `define-widget'.  It allows
you to create a shorthand for more complex widgets, including specifying
component widgets and new default values for the keyword arguments.

 - Function: define-widget name class doc &rest args
     Define a new widget type named NAME from `class'.

     NAME and class should both be symbols, `class' should be one of
     the existing widget types.

     The third argument DOC is a documentation string for the widget.

     After the new widget has been defined, the following two calls will
     create identical widgets:

        *      (widget-create NAME)

        *      (apply widget-create CLASS ARGS)


   Using `define-widget' just stores the definition of the widget type
in the `widget-type' property of NAME, which is what `widget-create'
uses.

   If you only want to specify defaults for keywords with no complex
conversions, you can use `identity' as your conversion function.

   The following additional keyword arguments are useful when defining
new widgets:
`:convert-widget'
     Function to convert a widget type before creating a widget of that
     type.  It takes a widget type as an argument, and returns the
     converted widget type.  When a widget is created, this function is
     called for the widget type and all the widget's parent types, most
     derived first.

     The following predefined functions can be used here:

      - Function: widget-types-convert-widget widget
          Convert `:args' as widget types in WIDGET.

      - Function: widget-value-convert-widget widget
          Initialize `:value' from `:args' in WIDGET.

`:value-to-internal'
     Function to convert the value to the internal format.  The function
     takes two arguments, a widget and an external value, and returns
     the internal value.  The function is called on the present `:value'
     when the widget is created, and on any value set later with
     `widget-value-set'.

`:value-to-external'
     Function to convert the value to the external format.  The function
     takes two arguments, a widget and an internal value, and returns
     the external value.  The function is called on the present `:value'
     when the widget is created, and on any value set later with
     `widget-value-set'.

`:create'
     Function to create a widget from scratch.  The function takes one
     argument, a widget type, and creates a widget of that type,
     inserts it in the buffer, and returns a widget object.

`:delete'
     Function to delete a widget.  The function takes one argument, a
     widget, and should remove all traces of the widget from the buffer.

`:value-create'
     Function to expand the `%v' escape in the format string.  It will
     be called with the widget as its argument and should insert a
     representation of the widget's value in the buffer.

`:value-delete'
     Should remove the representation of the widget's value from the
     buffer.  It will be called with the widget as its argument.  It
     doesn't have to remove the text, but it should release markers and
     delete nested widgets if such have been used.

     The following predefined function can be used here:

      - Function: widget-children-value-delete widget
          Delete all `:children' and `:buttons' in WIDGET.

`:value-get'
     Function to extract the value of a widget, as it is displayed in
     the buffer.

     The following predefined function can be used here:

      - Function: widget-value-value-get widget
          Return the `:value' property of WIDGET.

`:format-handler'
     Function to handle unknown `%' escapes in the format string.  It
     will be called with the widget and the character that follows the
     `%' as arguments.  You can set this to allow your widget to handle
     non-standard escapes.

     You should end up calling `widget-default-format-handler' to handle
     unknown escape sequences, which will handle the `%h' and any future
     escape sequences, as well as give an error for unknown escapes.

`:action'
     Function to handle user initiated events.  By default, `:notify'
     the parent.

     The following predefined function can be used here:

      - Function: widget-parent-action widget &optional event
          Tell `:parent' of WIDGET to handle the `:action'.  Optional
          EVENT is the event that triggered the action.

`:prompt-value'
     Function to prompt for a value in the minibuffer.  The function
     should take four arguments, WIDGET, PROMPT, VALUE, and UNBOUND and
     should return a value for widget entered by the user.  PROMPT is
     the prompt to use.  VALUE is the default value to use, unless
     UNBOUND is non-nil, in which case there is no default value.  The
     function should read the value using the method most natural for
     this widget, and does not have to check that it matches.

   If you want to define a new widget from scratch, use the `default'
widget as its base.

 - Widget: default
     Widget used as a base for other widgets.

     It provides most of the functionality that is referred to as "by
     default" in this text.

==============

   There is a separate package to browse widgets.  This is intended to
help programmers who want to examine the content of a widget.  The
browser shows the value of each keyword, but uses links for certain

========

   * It should be possible to add or remove items from a list with `C-k'
     and `C-o' (suggested by RMS).

   * The `[INS]' and `[DEL]' buttons should be replaced by a single
     dash (`-').  The dash should be a button that, when invoked, asks
     whether you want to add or delete an item (RMS wanted to git rid of
     the ugly buttons, the dash is my idea).

   * The `menu-choice' tag should be prettier, something like the
     abbreviated menus in Open Look.

   * Finish `:tab-order'.

   * Make indentation work with glyphs and proportional fonts.

   * Add commands to show overview of object and class hierarchies to
     the browser.

   * Find a way to disable mouse highlight for inactive widgets.

   * Find a way to make glyphs look inactive.

   * Add `property-list' widget.

   * Add `association-list' widget.

   * Add `key-binding' widget.

   * Add `widget' widget for editing widget specifications.

   * Find clean way to implement variable length list.  See
