;;; Commentary:
;;; This mode is a major mode for editing Ada83 and Ada95 source code.
;;; This is a major rewrite of the file packaged with Emacs-20.  The
;;; ada-mode is composed of four lisp file, ada-mode.el, ada-xref.el,
;;; ada-prj.el and ada-stmt.el. Only this file (ada-mode.el) is
;;; completely independent from the GNU Ada compiler Gnat, distributed
;;; by Ada Core Technologies. All the other files rely heavily on
;;; features provided only by Gnat.
;;;
;;; Note: this mode will not work with Emacs 19. If you are on a VMS
;;; system, where the latest version of Emacs is 19.28, you will need
;;; another file, called ada-vms.el, that provides some required
;;; functions.

;;; Usage:
;;; Emacs should enter Ada mode automatically when you load an Ada file.
;;; By default, the valid extensions for Ada files are .ads, .adb or .ada
;;; If the ada-mode does not start automatically, then simply type the
;;; following command :
;;;     M-x ada-mode
;;;
;;; By default, ada-mode is configured to take full advantage of the GNAT
;;; compiler (the menus will include the cross-referencing features,...).
;;; If you are using another compiler, you might want to set the following
;;; variable in your .emacs (Note: do not set this in the ada-mode-hook, it
;;; won't work) :
;;;    (setq ada-which-compiler 'generic)
;;;
;;; This mode requires find-file.el to be present on your system.

;;; History:
;;; The first Ada mode for GNU Emacs was written by V. Broman in
;;; 1985. He based his work on the already existing Modula-2 mode.
;;; This was distributed as ada.el in versions of Emacs prior to 19.29.
;;;
;;; Lynn Slater wrote an extensive Ada mode in 1989. It consisted of
;;; several files with support for dired commands and other nice
;;; things. It is currently available from the PAL
;;; (wuarchive.wustl.edu:/languages/ada) as ada-mode-1.06a.tar.Z.
;;;
;;; The probably very first Ada mode (called electric-ada.el) was
;;; written by Steven D. Litvintchouk and Steven M. Rosen for the
;;; Gosling Emacs. L. Slater based his development on ada.el and
;;; electric-ada.el.
;;;
;;; A complete rewrite by M. Heritsch and R. Ebert has been done.
;;; Some ideas from the Ada mode mailing list have been
;;; added.  Some of the functionality of L. Slater's mode has not
;;; (yet) been recoded in this new mode.  Perhaps you prefer sticking
;;; to his version.
;;;
;;; A complete rewrite for Emacs-20 / Gnat-3.11 has been done by Ada Core
;;; Technologies. Please send bugs to  briot@gnat.com

;;; Credits:
;;;   Many thanks to John McCabe <john@assen.demon.co.uk> for sending so
;;;     many patches included in this package.

;; Grammar related function
;; The functions below work with the syntax class of the characters in an Ada
;; buffer. Two syntax tables are created, depending on whether we want '_'
;; to be considered as part of a word or not.
;; Some characters may have multiple meanings depending on the context:
;;  - ' is either the beginning of a constant character or an attribute
;;  - # is either part of a based litteral or a gnatprep statement.
;;  - " starts a string, but not if inside a constant character.
;;  - ( and ) should be ignored if inside a constant character.
;; Thus their syntax property is changed automatically, and we can still use
;; the standard Emacs functions for sexp (see `ada-in-string-p')
;;
;; On Emacs, this is done through the `syntax-table' text property. The
;; modification is done automatically each time the user as typed a new
;; character. This is already done in `font-lock-mode' (in
;; `font-lock-syntactic-keywords', so we take advantage of the existing
;; mechanism. If font-lock-mode is not activated, we do it by hand in
;; `ada-after-change-function', thanks to `ada-deactivate-properties' and
;; `ada-initialize-properties'.
;;
;; on XEmacs, the `syntax-table' property does not exist and we have to use a
;; slow advice to `parse-partial-sexp' to do the same thing.
;; When executing parse-partial-sexp, we simply modify the strings before and
;; after, so that the special constants '"', '(' and ')' do not interact
;; with parse-partial-sexp.
;; Note: this code is slow and needs to be rewritten as soon as something
;; better is available on XEmacs.

;; Format Parameter Lists
;; Some special algorithms are provided to indent the parameter lists in
;; subprogram declarations. This is done in two steps:
;;  - First parses the parameter list. The returned list has the following
;;    format:
;;     ( (<Param_Name> in? out? access? <Type_Name> <Default_Expression>)
;;       ... )
;;    This is done in `ada-scan-paramlist'.
;;  - Delete and recreate the parameter list in function
;;    `ada-insert-paramlist'.
;; Both steps are called from `ada-format-paramlist'.
;; Note: Comments inside the parameter list are lost.
;;       The syntax has to be correct, or the reformating will fail.

;;;----------------------------------------------------------------
;;  Indentation Engine
;;  All indentations are indicated as a two-element string:
;;     - position of reference in the buffer
;;     - offset to indent from this position (can also be a symbol or a list
;;       that are evaluated)
;;  Thus the total indentation for a line is the column number of the reference
;;  position plus whatever value the evaluation of the second element provides.
;;  This mechanism is used so that the ada-mode can "explain" how the
;;  indentation was calculated, by showing which variables were used.
;;
;;  The indentation itself is done in only one pass: first we try to guess in
;;  what context we are by looking at the following keyword or punctuation
;;  sign. If nothing remarkable is found, just try to guess the indentation
;;  based on previous lines.
;;
;;  The relevant functions for indentation are:
;;  - `ada-indent-region': Re-indent a region of text
;;  - `ada-justified-indent-current': Re-indent the current line and shows the
;;    calculation that were done
;;  - `ada-indent-current': Re-indent the current line
;;  - `ada-get-current-indent': Calculate the indentation for the current line,
;;    based on the context (see above).
;;  - `ada-get-indent-*': Calculate the indentation in a specific context.
;;    For efficiency, these functions do not check they are in the correct
;;    context.
