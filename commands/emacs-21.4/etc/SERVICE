GNU Service Directory
---------------------

This is a list of people who have asked to be listed as offering
support services for GNU software, including GNU Emacs, for a fee
or in some cases at no charge.

The information comes from the people who asked to be listed;
we do not include any information we know to be false, but we
cannot check out any of the information; we are transmitting it to
you as it was given to us and do not promise it is correct.
Also, this is not an endorsement of the people listed here.
We have no opinions and usually no information about the abilities of
any specific person.  We provide this list to enable you to contact
service providers and decide for yourself whether to hire one.

Before FSF will list your name in the GNU Service Directory, we ask
that you agree informally to the following terms:

1. You will not restrict (except by copyleft) the use or distribution
of any software, documentation, or other technical information you
supply anyone in the course of modifying, extending, or supporting GNU
software.  This includes any information specifically designed to
ameliorate the use of GNU software.

2. You will not take advantage of contact made through the Service
Directory to advertise an unrelated business (e.g., sales of
non-GNU-related proprietary information).  You may spontaneously
mention your availability for general consulting, but you should not
promote a specific unrelated business unless the client asks.

Please include some indication of your rates, because otherwise users
have nothing to go by.	Please put each e-mail address inside "<>".
Please put nothing else inside "<>".  Thanks!

For a current copy of this directory, or to have yourself listed, ask:
	service@gnu.org

Allegro Consultants, Inc, in association with DIS International, is
now offering annual support contracts covering the GNU Compiler
Collection and related tools, including the GCC C and C++ compilers
for MPE/iX.

The free GCC C and C++ compilers have been available on MPE/iX for
several years now, and are used for mission-critical applications by
many organizations including Hewlett-Packard. Until now, assistance
was available only from Mark Klein of DIS on a limited, voluntary
basis. Mark is the person who originally ported GCC to the HP e3000,
and he continues to maintain the software and port new versions.

Support contracts start at $1,995.00/year for an organization
(unlimited number of HP e3000 computer systems) with two designated
callers.  Additional options are available for large organizations who
need to designate more than two authorized callers, or who want the
additional security of 24x7 coverage.

What I do:
        Primarily I work on GNU software for VMS, both VAX and AXP.  I've
        been porting GNU Emacs to VMS since spring 1991.  I've  ported a
        bunch of other GNU programs as well.  I maintain GNU vmslib.
        For further info, see http://www.lp.se/~levitte/prof/resume.html

Programs supported:
        To a varying degree (ranging from extension and porting to
        installation and simple questions) at the time of updating this
        entry:
        - GNU vmslib, emacs, autoconf, zip, diffutils, m4, patch, texinfo,
          C/C++; on both VMS and Unix.
        - Other GNU programs to a small degree; on Unix.
        For further info, look at http://www.lp.se/products/gnu.html

Experience:
        Fluent in TeX/LaTeX and many programming languages.
        Modified key elements in Emacs (e.g., memory and process management)
        to work transparently on VMS.  I have very good knowledge in the VMS
        operating system.  I'm also knowledged in the a few Unix flavors.
        For further info, see http://www.lp.se/~levitte/prof/resume.html

Your Rate:
        $70-$100/hour (500-800 SEK in sweden), plus expenses.  My rates

I will gladly help novice and intermediate computer users to install,
understand, and use free software, whether or not I have prior
experience with that software.  I know my limitations well, and will
freely give other contacts if I cannot solve your problem myself.

I have over 5 years of experience with several of the major free OSes:
GNU/Linux (Debian, Red Hat), NetBSD, FreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd.  Some of
my specialties are networking, Emacs, Automake, Autoconf, C, Perl, and
shell script programming.

My rates are negotiable depending on the task: usually $40-$60
(Canadian) per hour.  Flat rates preferred.

          resources for $2 billion summer cleanup, predictions were
          accurate.
               2. I built a model applying commercial capital

   3. Helping people who are willing to port and provide GNU software 
      to their customers, but are unable to do so due to  a lack of resources.

      the results with others but to eliminate unnecessary investment also. 
   6. Passing the result to the program package maintainers (if needed).
