# make all	to compile and build Emacs.
# make install	to install it.
# make TAGS	to update tags tables.
#
# make clean  or  make mostlyclean
#      Delete all files from the current directory that are normally
#      created by building the program.	 Don't delete the files that
#      record the configuration.  Also preserve files that could be made
#      by building, but normally aren't because the distribution comes
#      with them.
#
#      Delete `.dvi' files here if they are not part of the distribution.
# 
# make distclean
#      Delete all files from the current directory that are created by
#      configuring or building the program.  If you have unpacked the
#      source and built the program without creating any other files,
#      `make distclean' should leave only the files that were in the
#      distribution.
# 
# make realclean
#      Delete everything from the current directory that can be
#      reconstructed with this Makefile.  This typically includes
#      everything deleted by distclean, plus more: C source files
#      produced by Bison, tags tables, info files, and so on.
#
# make extraclean
#      Still more severe - delete backup and autosave files, too.

# This gork is required for those who use a Unix-style shell, and
# have SHELL in the environment pointing to it.  Here we force
# Make to use COMMAND.COM instead.  This Makefile won't work otherwise.
# (The /xyzzy directory is used to minimize the chance that someone
# actually has such a directory with an incompatible command.com.  We
# used to have /dos there, but some Windows installations have an old
# version of DOS stashed in that directory, and command.com from there
# won't run on Windows, complaining about "Incorrect DOS version".
# Make will look up PATH for the shell executable, so the directory name
# is not important.)
