This directory contains the EM machine specification.

The specification is encoded in the file 'em_table', which is processed
by the shell script 'new_table'. The invocation of new_table takes two
arguments:
    new_table $(TARGET_HOME)/h $(SRC_HOME)/util/data

The file 'em_table' has a very special structure:
 section 1: <command> <opcode>
 section 2: <command> <offset> <condn> - fpseu command
 section 3: <command> <code1> <code2> - fmnem command
		code1 has two characters -> PAR_\1 | FLO_\2
			where - is interpreted as 'NO'
		code2 is not used
