This file contains a summary of the bugs/features/inconsistencies
Robbert and Ed found while making the linker usable for the 68000 and amoeba.
I (Ceriel Jacobs) took the liberty of removing the ones that I fixed from
this list.

Another problem form the commons:

...

2 - The commons are allocated at the very end of the first pass, after the
    initialezed data has been allocated in the segments. The order on which
    the commons are allocated seems to be random. That way it is impossible
    to produce a label that is guaranteed to point to the last byte (+1)
    of a segment containing commons.
    The currently used trick is to declare an extra segment after the
    segment containing the commons. The first bytre in this segment
    inmediatly follows the commons and can be used as _end or endbss.
