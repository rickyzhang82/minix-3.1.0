/*	To centralize the declaration of %tokens, their presence in this

	a grammar file (tokenfile.g) from this file.
	Moreover, rather than looking up a symbol in all these lists
	to find its printable name, a fast version of symbol2str() is
	generated from these tables.
	Consequenty some of these tables are not referenced explicitly
	in the C text any more.  To save space and to avoid lint confusion,
	these have been made pseudo-invisible by #ifdefs.
