.SH NAME
em_nopt \- EM peephole optimizer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ~em/lib.bin/em_nopt
[ inputfile [ outputfile ] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Em_nopt reads a compact EM-program inputfile or standard input,
and produces another compact EM program on outputfile or standard output
that is functionally equivalent,
but smaller.
This program is a faster replacement for the program em_opt but does not
perform some other functions that that program performed and were required
before running a codegenerator. These operations are now performed by the
front ends and the EM_CODE(3) module. The old program is still required
for front ends that do not use the new mechanisms or for making a library
module.
Usually this program need not be run as the front end will perform the
equivalent optimizations using the library module em_opt(3).
