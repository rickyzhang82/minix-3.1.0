FTP SECURITY WARNING

If you are running an FTP server on a Minix system please be aware that
a security vulnerability was discovered in ftpd version 1.00.  It has
been determined that the vulnerability was present in all earlier
versions of ftpd, including those released with all versions of Minix
2.0.x through 2.0.4.  The vulnerability was fixed with the release of
ftpd 1.01 in early February 2005, at the same time that existence of
the problem with earlier versions was announced on comp.os.minix and
the minix-l mailing list.  If you are running version 1.01 you are
probably safe, but upgrading to version 2.00 is recommended.  Version
1.01 was the result of a quick effort to fix the vulnerability, version
2.00 reimplements critical parts of the code.

There should be no problems with compilation of ftpd 2.00 on any 2.0.x
version of Minix, but I haven't tested this. Please let me know of
any problems by e-mail to awoodhull@hampshire.edu.
