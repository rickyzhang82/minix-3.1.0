  or not-large-enough devices
. fixed a bug that would case FS to loop forever (can happen on 
  writing nonexistant blocks)

  to a process that killed itself during a signal handler (causing delayed
  delivery of a lethal signal). More info in bug no. 2.
. new log device (/dev/klog) that makes the kernel and system server
  diagnostic messages available to userland, for a syslogd.
. usyslogd, a tiny syslogd that currently just writes /dev/klog
  line by line (with date+hostname) to /var/log/messages.
